     <p class="side"> <h2 class="heading"> Maramula Waterfalls </h2> <br> 
 Located at a distance of few kms from Erattupetta in Kottayam inside a private rubber estate, Marmala Waterfalls are popularly known as the ‘enchantress of the jungle’. Plummeting from a height of 200 feet, the unblemished clear waters create an aura of mist around them. The tantalising waterfalls splash into a 12 feet pond and run down to join the river Teekoy. <br> <br>
 Only a four-wheel drive Jeep can go through the narrow path, often passing over the uneven rocky terrain where no car would go. Even the jeep will not take you to the bottom of the falls.<br><br> 
 The waterfalls also offer trekking opportunities. However, the rough terrain is very difficult to trek; the road is slippery and full of rocky obstacles. <br> <br> Best Time to visit is- November to February <br> Visiting Time:Early Morning and early Evening </p> <br> <br> <br>
